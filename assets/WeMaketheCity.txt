About
We are the city. How we move in this space makes it what it is. This year’s festival is about celebrating and exploring this idea. We’re using the city both as the festival’s venue and as the canvass for the individual projects that make it up. Some projects have a specific time and place; others live more nebulously in our shared space. We encourage you to take part in the festival by visiting events or by simply getting out and exploring the city you live in. 

We Make The City! We Are The City! is put on by Artengine, a centre for art, design and research based in Ottawa. 

Design Challenge
You are the city, and we want you to take part. Make a poster about improving the city and share it with us. We’ll print it and post it around the city streets as part of a collaborative project. Need some inspiration? Browse through the submissions made so far. 

Agit POV Workshop
Presented in partnership with Community Arts and Public engagement, City of Ottawa
Artists: Mariangela Aponte, Alexandre Castonguay,  Thomas Ouellet Fredericks, Henri Kuschkowitz and Anthony Scavarelli

Agit POV is a simple LED device for the spokes of your wheel that makes clever use of your pedal power, turning your bicycle wheel into a personal billboard. Join the workshop, build your own POV, and take part in a light ride across town. Visit http://agitpov.wordpress.com/ for more details on the Agit POV. 

Sign up in advance: Contact Remco Volmer at electricfields@artengine.ca or 613.686.1941
$20 | max 15 participants
September 11 and 12 // 7-9PM // Artengine Lab, 2 Daly Ave


You Are Here (tentative name)
Artists: Elizabeth McKinnon, Kwende Kfenste and Mathieu Trudell

Using an intricate combination of projection and live performance, You Are Here encourages us to reconsider our movement through the built world around us. Come see dancers animate and interact with large projections as they push and pull the structures under our feet.  (More detail here?? I wish I had more!!!)

September 11 and 12 // starting at 8:30PM // 700 Sussex Drive

Rhythm Ride (tentative name)
With Ghetto Blast Sound System and in collaboration with Velo Vogue

A simple ride around the canal becomes a crowd-sourced concert by way of radios, gears, LEDs, pedals, processors and a mobile sound system. 

Anyone is welcome to join this musical bike parade. An original piece of music will be generated as modified walkie-talkies collect and distribute your cycling sounds.  The composition will be broadcast through an off-the-grid sound system and a local (VLF) FM transmission. Everyone is encouraged to bring an FM radio and tune in. More radios means more fun. There are a limited number of walkie-talkies available, so come early to have your bike be part of the symphony!

Sponsored by The Ottawa Art Gallery

Also check out Ghetto Blast’s mobile dance parade heading towards the Ottawa Mini-Maker Faire on August 31 at the Museum of Science and Technology. 

September 14 // 7PM // meet at the Corktown Footbridge (east side) 

Land Line
Presented by Megan Smith

Land Line aims to tell the story of the city from the perspective of the people who live in it. 

Call in and record your story of a place in the city that is important to you. These stories will help build a people map of memories and meaningful locations. Get your story in early, and have your meaningful place marked by a special edition vinyl sticker. 

Check back soon to get the number and site to record your story.

Ongoing // various locations



Agit POV
Brief: Agit POV is a simple LED device for the spokes of your wheel that makes clever use of your pedal power, turning your bicycle wheel into an personal billboard. Join this workshop; build your own POV and take part in the light ride across town.

Info: Participants will sign up for workshop. We can take up to 15. We are looking at a $20 fee. People will work on building the final parts of their own device. The material costs of the unit are over $50 so this is considerably subsidized. This workshop will be run as well with community partners in Vanier. The culmination of this workshop will be a street party in Vanier (still in development with City). This may double as the closing party for the festival and and organized ride with the light projects.

Website details on this project here.

It is being executed locally with the Luminartists.

You Are Here (tentative name)
Elizabeth McKinnon, Kwende Kfenste and Mathieu Trudell
You Are Here reconsiders our movement through the built world around us through an intricate combination of projection and live performance. 

Riddim Ride (tentative name)
with Ghetto Blast Sound System
A project in collaboration with Velo Vogue
Sponsored by The Ottawa Art Gallery

Brief: An interconnection of radios, gears, LEDs, pedals, processors and a mobile sound system create a crowd-sourced concert. Bring your FM radio along and become part of the mobile sound system. A simple ride around the canal becomes a musical experience.

Info: At the heart of this project is an off-the-grid sound system that will be leading the bike parade, but a collection of walkie-talkies will collect and distribute processed sounds from the bicycles to create a musical piece. Early arrivals will become part of the ride and have the modified walkie-talkies attached temporairily to their bicycles.

The piece will also make use of Very Low Frequency FM transmitter that will broadcast the musical composition over a pirated FM station (preferably one not in use), and those who bring radios will tune in and expand the capacity of the sound system. We will also purchase a dozen or so radios to provide on the night of. 

Ghetto Blast will be also be running a mobile dance parade as a creative way to head to the Ottawa Mini-Maker Faire on August 31st at the Museum of Science and Technology. They will be running their Sound System there as an exhibitor and a promotion of the sound piece during We Make The City! We Are The City!

Land Line
Megan Smith

Call in and make your special place our history. Land Line will build a story of our city from everyone’s perspective. Using a simple web application Land Line records your telling of a place and time in the city. We are building a people map to overlay and intersect with your existing idea of the city. 

Info: This project will have a phone number that participants will be able to call and record their stories about a important places to them in the city. We will use a combination of software and human resources to geo-locate these stories. The artists will be printing a series of vinyl stickers to identify the first 20-30 stories out in the city itself. Those stickers will use both QR codes and website addresses to bring people to the specific story of the space they have found the sticker at.


Playing the park(Tentative)
Jesse Stewart
A collective musical performance in the park based on the design of the park itself.


Bridgeplay (Tentative)
Jesse Stewart

Jesse Stewart will be producing a music video with the sound constructed/composed from a percusion performance he will do on the Alexandra Bridge behind the National Gallery. Jesse will also produce a hybrid score/map which will be downloadable from the We Make The City! website so you can go and play the bridge yourself.
